# Components
In an Entity–Component–System (ECS) architecture, a component is a small, data-only object that represents a single aspect or attribute of an entity. It contains no behavior—just values.

A component is a container of pure data that describes some property of an entity, such as position, health, or velocity.

Components should be:
- classes
- data only
- no logic
- tiny and simple
- named with nouns
