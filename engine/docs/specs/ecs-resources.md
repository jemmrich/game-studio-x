# Resources
In an Entity–Component–System (ECS) architecture, a resource is a piece of data that exists globally rather than being tied to any single entity. Systems can read or modify it as needed.

A resource is a globally accessible data object used by systems to manage shared state, such as input data, game settings, or world time.
