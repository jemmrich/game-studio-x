# Game Studio X (Game Engine)
Game Studio X is a modern, lightweight game engine built with Deno, TypeScript, Vite, Three.js, and Rapier, designed around a robust Entity Component System (ECS) architecture. It enables fast, modular game development with real-time physics, high-performance rendering, and streamlined tooling. Game Studio X focuses on developer ergonomics, hot-reload workflows, and clean code composition, offering a scalable foundation for 2D/3D interactive experiences on the web.

## The Monorepo
This game engine is in heavy early development and therefore this monorepo holds not only the game engine, but games in various states of development.
